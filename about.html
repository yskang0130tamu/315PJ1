I am majoring in Computer Science and have about a year left for graduation. 
I had a lot of interest in computers and programming since middle school and I feel very lucky to be studying my field of interest.

I learned how to code in Java and developed my skills in C++. 
I cannot say that I am the best at coding, but I do feel pretty comfortable with those two languages. 
As more as I study Computer Science, the more I feel how small I know about computers. With this attitude, 
I am putting in my best effort to be a better self when I graduate.

Working as a team is something I love to do. I had an opportunity to work at the <a href="https://spri.kr/">Software Policy R&D Institute of Korea</a> and experienced how it is like working in an R&D Institute. 
It was my first time to work with experts in my field of study and it helped me build a social and respectful personality that is humble but not shy. 
I love to talk and be around people and learn new stuff!
