<p style = "text-align:left;">Howdy! I am Youn, a junior student studying at Texas A&M University. 
This is my homepage that shows a lot of who I am, what I want to be, and what I am as of now. 
To the left of the page, there are links to my portfolio, qualifications, and services. </p>

<p style = "text-align:left;">To briefly introduce myself, I am majoring in Computer Science and have about a year left for graduation. 
I had a lot of interest in computers and programming since middle school and I feel very lucky to be studying my field of interest. 
Other than computers, I spend a lot time driving and flying because I just love being in control a vehicle or a plane. 
I drive a manual car, have a bus license and currently working toward a private pilot license. 
This probably shows how much enthusiasm I have in driving and flying!
</p>

Here is a link of myself in the cockpit while my friend who has a private pilot license is landing at Easterwood Airport, College Station.

Here is a link of myself in the rear seat to learn how to perform a go-around.

<p style = "text-align:left;">I have not had a chance to work in the United States since I am not authorized to work, 
but I had various working experience in my country, South Korea. 
I worked as an intern at the Software Policy R&D Institute of Korea and experienced how it is like working in an R&D Institute. 
This was a great opportunity for me, because it was my first time to work with experts in my field of study. Other than the internship, 
I have experience in several part-time jobs such as working as a restaurant cook, a parking assistant and a hotelier. 
These working opportunities helped me build a social and respectful personality that is humble but not shy. 
I love to talk and be around people and learn new stuff!</p>

<p style = "text-align:left;">I will talk a little bit more about my Computer Science side. 
I learned how to code in Java and developed my skills in C++. 
I cannot say that I am the best at coding, but I do feel pretty comfortable with those two languages. 
As more as I study Computer Science, the more I feel how small I know about computers. With this attitude, 
I am putting in my best effort to be a better self when I graduate. </p>
